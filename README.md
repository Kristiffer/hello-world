# hello-world
Learning Github 
First attempt at learning coding and using github
Changing carreers from technician to coder,,, (hopefuly) 
I have been working in manufacturing for many years as a tech, working on machines, automation and robotics. 
Instead of working on the electro-mechanical part of machines, I want to learn the instructions that make them work.
